# Predicting OCEAN indeces with ML models

Description of your project goes here.

## Content
### Custom genetic Algoryth
This is a complex algorythm that generates binary vectors in 40 dimensions that calculates the fitness function by using crossover and mutation methods. This process has been improved by using Multithreading.

After that complex solution of finding the binary vectors. Algorythm start the process of an Automated Machine learning search:

## Final Results
This is the final result of Improving the accuracy by using those methods
